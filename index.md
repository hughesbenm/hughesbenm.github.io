# Arch Installation and Customization Guide
### Introduction
This guide is for the purpose of going through the step by step process by which I installed and customized my own version of Arch Linux for my System Admin class. It should be robust enough that by following the steps and the steps alone you can completely recreate what I have on my machine. That being said, this is for a project, as such there are some particularities that will be unique to me/members of my class. This includes mentions of a "classroom gateway" as well as VMWare. When these topcis come up and/or diverge from what a normal Arhc Linux user's experience will be, I will clarify so.

### The ISO File
The first step to installing Arhc Linux is downloading the iso file from any one of various mirrors. Select one from [this website](http://mirrors.acm.wpi.edu/archlinux/iso/2021.10.01/) and download it.

### Partitioning the Drives
First, run ```fdisk -l``` to show your drives.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/hughesbenm/hughesbenm.github.io/edit/main/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/hughesbenm/hughesbenm.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
